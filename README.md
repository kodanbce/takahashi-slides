Minimal [Takahashi method slideshow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) viewer

Usage
---

You can provide the slides either as an embedded plaintext file or by referring to a remote file by its URL.

The plaintext slides file should contain one slide per line.

To use the embedded file, open `index.html` in an editor and edit the `#presentation` element. Then open `index.html` in a browser to see the presentation.

To use to a remote file, open `index.html` in a browser and add `?url=[remote_file]` to the URL.
